# Weather-App

## Description
This weather dashboard pulls weather data from an API called OpenWeather.
When a user enters a valid city, it will display the current weather and it also forecasts the weather 5 days in advance.

## What was your motivation?
- Utilizing API's that are already out there saved me so much time.
- In my mind I have a clear vision of what I want my work to look like, but I was boggled by the fact that where would I get my data from,
so being able to do this gave me the confidence needed to build more projects that utilizes API's.

## Why did I build this project?
- I wanted to grasp a better understanding of API's, so I created this interface and gained more knowledge about Javascript and APi's.

## What did I learn?
- API's were confusing at first, but after building the code, I slowly started to understood the syntax much more and utilized the API's that are already out there in the world.
